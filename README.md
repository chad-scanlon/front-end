Proposal
What problem does your app solve?

- Our app allows clients and trainers to manage their class schedules and memberships remotely. Rather than need to be in-person at the gym, clients can view class schedules and sign up for classes, while trainers can add and delete classes.

How does your app solve the problem?

- Clients will log in and have their membership authenticated, then select classes based on certain criteria (type, duration, intensity level) to attend. Trainers will log in and have their authorizaiton validated, then add and delete said classes.

What is the mission statement?

- We will bring the gym to you.
